Hello, I am Artificial Intelligence MSc student at University of Leeds and an incoming PhD student at University College London Foundational AI starting September 2023. I have been working as master intern in the Computational Light Laboratory at University College London. I am also experienced in multiâ€‘physics simulation engineer creating numerical methods to improve modeling of automotive propulsion systems including Formula 1 racing cars.

This is my AI related research/portfolio page. If you want to look at my previous engineering career (publications, patents etc.), please find me on LinkedIn. I am active member of Mensa UK where I meet with great friends.
